# 🩺 DERM-AI – Skin Disease Detection Using Inception-ResNet-v2

DERM-AI is a deep learning–based skin disease classification system designed to assist in early diagnosis using image analysis. The model is built using **Inception-ResNet-v2**, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture, and is deployed as a REST API using **Flask**. Users can upload a skin image and receive predictions for various skin diseases within seconds.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The project uses **Inception-ResNet-v2**, which combines the strength of Inception modules with residual connections for:

- Faster convergence  
- Improved accuracy  
- Better handling of complex skin textures  

The final layers were fine-tuned on the skin disease dataset to optimize classification performance.
